With the amount of sports stats and data available, this is an excellent arena to hone your data exploration and visualization skills.

And this is the perfect idea for your next machine learning project!
Social media is thriving with tons of user-generated content. By creating an ML system that could analyze the sentiment behind texts, or a post, it would become so much easier for organizations to understand the consumer behaviour. This, in turn, would allow them to improve their customer service, thereby providing the scope for optimal consumer satisfaction.
You can try to mine the data from Twitter or Reddit to get started off with your sentiment analyzing machine learning project.
