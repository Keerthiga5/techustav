									  <td>Although most of us use social media platforms to convey our personal feelings and opinions for the world to see, one of the biggest challenges lies in understanding the ‘sentiments’ behind social media posts.
And this is the perfect idea for your next machine learning project!
Social media is thriving with tons of user-generated content. By creating an ML system that could analyze the sentiment behind texts, or a post, it would become so much easier for organizations to understand the consumer behaviour. This, in turn, would allow them to improve their customer service, thereby providing the scope for optimal consumer satisfaction.
You can try to mine the data from Twitter or Reddit to get started off with your sentiment analyzing machine learning project.
